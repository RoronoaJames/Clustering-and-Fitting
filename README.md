# Clustering-and-Fitting

Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the wine dataset sourced from Kaggle, focusing on clustering and fitting techniques to uncover patterns and insights in the data. The analysis aims to classify different types of wines based on their chemical properties, providing valuable information for wine enthusiasts, producers, and marketers.

Objectives
Data Exploration: Investigate the underlying structure of the wine dataset using various statistical and visualization techniques.
Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) to categorize wines into distinct groups based on their attributes.
Model Fitting: Utilize regression and classification models to predict wine quality and explore the relationships between various chemical properties.
Performance Evaluation: Assess the performance of the clustering and fitting models through metrics such as silhouette score, model accuracy, and confusion matrix.
